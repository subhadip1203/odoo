# Odoo 
I am trying to working on oddo.

there is 2 parts.\:

1. install on Windows OS  using WSL - ubuntu
2. install on native Ubuntu OS


### windows with WSL

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is installing linux os on windows without any external virtualbox.

install Ubuntu22 on WSL.

then run the project `project_wsl_ubuntu`
